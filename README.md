## Hi there, I am Nathaniel Suarez :wave:

<p>Graduated at California State University - Los Angeles with a Bachelors Degree in Computer Science. I have an interest in software engineering with a passion for learning new technologies whether its in the frontend or backend. I have always wanted to use my software engineering skills to develop software that can help solve problems for customers or clients. For my senior project, I had a chance to do that called [the arQive](https://thearqive.com/), a social media platform for the lgbtq community, where users could share their own story for everybody to see.
